# NYC's Median Rent by Borough
**Background**
This web application extracts data from StreetEasyâ€™s public database and produces charts of NYC's median rent over time.

I built this app in 2021 to look back at the changes in median rent before COVID, at the peak of COVID, and after COVID. 

This app was written in Python and the following Python libraries:
- `requests`, for making HTTP requests and getting data from StreetEasy
- `zipfile` and `io`, for processing the zipped data file from StreetEasy
- `pandas`, for analyzing the CSV data file
- `altair`, for beautiful visualizations

The backbone of this app is Streamlit, an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects that allows developers to quickly create beautiful web apps in minutes.
